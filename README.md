# Solidity-Distributed-Cab-Service
A solidity smart contract application through which customers can ask for cabs and cab drivers can
respond to their requests. Customers can provide their source and destination address to the contract so
that the drivers can decide whether to entertain the request or not. Let there be an auction among the
drivers through which the smart contract will decide which driver to allocate the customer. The auction will
be on the rates provided by the drivers for a particular ride. Once the driver is confirmed, the contract should
broadcast this result. You are at liberty to decide the auction rules and type.
